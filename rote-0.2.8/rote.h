/* Color codes: 0 = black, 1 = red, 2 = green, 3 = yellow, 4 = blue,

 * An 'attribute' as used in this library means an 8-bit value that conveys
 * a foreground color code, a background color code, and the bold
 * and blink bits. Each cell in the virtual terminal screen is associated
 * with an attribute that specifies its appearance. The bits of an attribute,
 * from most significant to least significant, are 
 *
 *  bit:      7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
 *  content:  S F F F H B B B
 *            | `-,-' | `-,-'
 *            |   |   |   |
 *            |   |   |   `----- 3-bit background color code (0 - 7)
 *            |   |   `--------- blink bit (if on, text is blinking)
 *            |   `------------- 3-bit foreground color code (0 - 7)
 *            `----------------- bold bit
 *
 * It is however recommended that you use the provided macros rather
 * than dealing with this format directly.
 *
 * Sometimes we will call the 'SFFF' nibble above the 'extended
 * foreground color code', and the 'HBBB' nibble the 'extended background
 * color code'. So the extended color codes are just the regular
 * color codes except that they have an additional bit (the most significant
 * bit) indicating bold/blink.
